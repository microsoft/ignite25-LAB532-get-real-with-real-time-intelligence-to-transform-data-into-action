# Before you start

> [!TIP]
> As you follow the instructions in this pane, whenever you see a +++icon+++, you can use it to copy text from the instruction pane into the virtual machine interface. This is particularly useful to copy code; but bear in mind you may need to modify the pasted code to fix indent levels or formatting before running it!

## Sign into Windows

1. In the virtual machine, sign into Windows using the following credentials:
   - **User name**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-Pro-Base-VM).Username+++
   - **Password**: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-Pro-Base-VM).Password+++

## Create a trial Teams account

1. In the virtual machine, open Microsoft Teams from the desktop or taskbar.
2. When prompted, sign in using the following credentials:
   - **Email**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++
   - **Password**: +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password+++
3. Complete the sign up process to create a new account.
4. After signing in to Teams, select **OK** when prompted to stay signed in to all your apps and then select **Done** to complete. Wait until the process finishes and the **Start trial** option appears.
5. Choose **Start Trial** and when prompted allow Teams to be the default app for chats and calls select **Continue**. If the process fails, please click the Retry button until it succeeds.

## Exercises in this lab

Now you're ready to complete the exercises in this lab. The lab includes multiple exercises, so when you finish one, just move onto the next one. The exercises in this lab are:

- Create an eventhouse in Microsoft Fabric
- Get data in the Real-Time Hub in Microsoft Fabric
- Query streaming data in a KQL queryset in Microsoft Fabric
- Create a Real-Time dashboard in Microsoft Fabric
- Create a Power BI report in Microsoft Fabric

The exercises are designed to be completed in order because they build on the data and resources created in the previous exercises, so make sure you complete each exercise before moving on to the next one.

Don't worry if you run out of time to complete the entire lab. All of these exercises (and more) are available on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/tutorial-introduction). You can also find more details about [Activating a Fabric trial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial) on Microsoft Learn.
