# Real-Time Intelligence tutorial part 10: Clean up resources

## Clean up resources

Once you finish the lab, you might want to delete all resources you created. You can delete the eventstream, eventhouse, KQL queryset, Real-Time dashboard, Fabric Activator, Map and Data agent items individually, or you can delete the entire workspace.

1. Browse to the workspace in which you created the tutorial.
1. From the menu ribbon, select **Workspace settings**.
1. In the **General** settings pane, scroll down to the **Delete workspace** section.
1. Select **Remove this workspace**.
1. On the warning dialog, select **Delete**. Once a workspace is deleted, it can't be recovered.
